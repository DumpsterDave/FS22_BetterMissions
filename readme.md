## About
Better Missions changes how mission payouts work.  Instead of a flat $/Ha reward, payouts are based on the time required to complete the mission.  Mission times are calculated by using the equipment that is offered for rent with the mission.  All missions payout a base rate of $20,000/hr.  Missions that require you to provide resources (Fertilize/Sow/Spray) will also re-imburse you for materials you have to buy.  Re-imbursements are also adjusted according to the type and quantity of resource you will need to complete the mission instead of the previous flat rate.  For instance, sowing missions that require more seed (potato) will re-imburse more than those that require less (cotton).  Mission descriptions have also been updated to indicate the anticipated "Field Time" to complete the mission.  This time only takes into account time the tool will be working on the field, not transport times, turns, unloads, etc.  Harvest mission descriptions will also display the required amount of fruit to be deposited to complete the mission.
