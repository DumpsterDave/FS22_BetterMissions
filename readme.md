## Better Missions for FS22

This mod updates the reward tables for mission to pay out at $10,000/hr based one field size and equipment used.  The mod uses the borrowed equipment table to calculate how long it will take to complete the field with the given equipment and then adjusts the payment structure accordingly.  

Compared to the original game, some missions may pay less than before while others will pay more.  Mission generation freqeuncy is also updated to occur once every game hour instead of once every four.

The mission info display is also updated for harvest missions to show how much grain the field owner expects you to deliver.
